Sorry, but this page doesn't seem to exist. Or is it there?

In fact, there is a 50% chance that this page exists and a 50% chance that it does not exist,

This is a quantum page!


Anyway, this page was not found. Then you can try again or try another page.

<div id="text"></div>
<div id="imagem"></div>


<script>
var y = Math.floor((Math.random() * 2) + 1);
var greet;
var img1 = document.createElement("img");

if (y == 1) {
  greet = "The page exists!";
  img1.src = "/images/andre.png";
} else  {
  greet = "The page does not exists!";
  img1.src = "/images/andre.png";
}
</script>


<script>
document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = greet;
document.getImageById("imagem").innerHTML = img1;

</script>
